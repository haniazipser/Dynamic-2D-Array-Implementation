This project implements a program that allows user to perform a series of array operations on a two-dimensional array. Each row may have a different number of columns, and the number of rows can also change dynamically based on the input operations.

 Key Features

- Full support for all specified operations (adding/removing/swapping rows and columns, inserting submatrices, file input/output).
-  Highly memory-efficient, avoiding unnecessary allocations and reallocations.
-  Uses a custom dynamic data structure designed to:
  - Efficiently support variable-length rows,
  - Enable fast insertions and deletions,
  - Minimize memory fragmentation.
- Clean implementation in pure C
